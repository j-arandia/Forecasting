# Machine Learning for Movie Box Office Prediction

## Description:
The project utilized supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Hierarchical Clustering. Linear Regression and Random Forest were employed for predictive modeling, leveraging their capabilities to capture relationships between features and box office earnings. Hierarchical Clustering was utilized for exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and relationships within the dataset.

## Data Set:
The dataset, titled "Movie Database: Ratings, Budgets, and Box Office Earnings," consisted of comprehensive information about movies, including production budgets, viewer votes, genres, and worldwide as well as domestic box office earnings. By combining multiple tables into a unified dataset, we created a rich feature set suitable for modeling and analysis.

## Algorithms Used:

Linear Regression: A supervised learning model used to predict continuous outcome variables based on predictor variables.
Random Forest: An ensemble learning algorithm utilized for both classification and regression tasks, known for its high predictive accuracy and ability to handle complex relationships.
Hierarchical Clustering: An unsupervised learning technique employed for cluster analysis and revealing data structure through the creation of dendrograms.

## Accuracy Comparison:
Random Forest emerged as the most suitable algorithm for predicting movie earnings due to its ability to capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features. Linear Regression exhibited accuracy in cases of linear relationships, particularly observed between budget and earnings. Hierarchical Clustering, while not suited for predictive accuracy, provided valuable insights into data structure and relationships within the dataset.

In conclusion, this project demonstrated the application of machine learning in predicting movie box office performance, offering valuable insights for stakeholders in the film industry and showcasing the potential of data-driven decision-making to enhance financial success.
